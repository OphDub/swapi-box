# SWapi Box

## Synopsis

This was an individual project to help reinforce the concepts of writing asynchronous nested fetch calls, start working with React Router, and continue practicing creating modular React components. We utilized the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/documentation) to get information about about 'People', 'Vehicles', and 'Planets' from the various movies. The data was used to create a web app which displayed information via cards components rendered to the page.
